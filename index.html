      Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, between <br> the 16th and mid-18th century. The word pizza was first documented in AD 997 in <br> Gaeta and successively in different parts of Central and Southern Italy. Pizza was mainly eaten <br> in Italy and by emigrants from there.<br>

      1.You don’t need to make homemade dough. Yes, it's yummy but many commercial <br> varieties are available in your local market or at Trader Joe’s. Many pizzerias <br>are willing to sell the dough too. Let it come to room temperature before topping though.<br>
      <br>
      2.You do need a pizza stone though. A sheet pan will not be big enough for a <br>decent circular pizza and more importantly will not produce the crispy bottom <br>surface that a stone will. Get something simple, no need for <br> a fancy one, any brand made from stone is great.<br>

      3.For homemade sauce, recipes below. Starting with great sauce adds depth of <br>flavor. Recipes: My Favorite Super Simple Pizza Red Sauce, My Favorite White Sauce.<br>
      <br>
      4.Don’t use too much cheese, use other flavor enhancers like pesto, crushed <br>red pepper, oregano, garlic, etc.<br>
      <br>
      5.Drizzle with olive oil and kosher salt before baking.<br>
